# GitHub Curriculum

This repo contains a curriculum for teaching GitHub to people with some coding experience.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this curriculum, students will be able to:

* Define version control and describe its use
* Describe the differences between git and GitHub
* Create and commit to local repositories
* Connect a local git repo to a GitHub repo
* Push local commits to GitHub
* Define branches
* Create and use branches as part of a standard git workflow
* Create, review, and merge pull requests on GitHub
* Understand and resolve merge conflicts
* Use branches on a team project to organize code
* Write README files in Markdown to describe their projects
* Complete a team project using Git and GitHub as their version control system of choice

## Software

For this course, you will need to install the following programs and tools.

### VSCode

Visual Studio Code is a free, modern code editor used by everyone from small companies to tech giants. Install for Windows, Mac or Linux from [their website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### git

Git is the command line tool that will allow us to perform version control, which is a key objective of the course. Installation instructions vary per operating system.

#### git for Mac

Open your Terminal application and, at the command prompt, type `git --version`. If you do not already have `git` installed, this will prompt you to install it.

Once the installation has finished, close and re-open your terminal, and type `git --version`. If it has installed correctly, you will see a version number as the output.

#### git for Windows

TBD
