## Project Expectations

For your project this week, the expectation is that you make something fun and interesting. You'll have limited time to work on this project - this afternoon to plan, tomorrow morning to refine your plan, and then Thursday all day and Friday morning to write your code. You'll also need to prep for your presentation on Friday afternoon. So you will only have about 12 hours during our scheduled time to write code, plus any time you choose to work on this project after hours.

That's a really short timeline! So, be sure you're thinking about a reasonable scope for your project. A general rule of thumb in software engineering is to assume everything will take 2-3 times as long as you think, to account for the time you'll spend doing code review, fixing bugs, and generally doing stuff other than just writing code.

Also, your teams are built to put you, as much as possible, with people of a similar experience level & interests. We expect that your projects will all look very different from each other - the focus is on making sure that you use GitHub to build the project, and that you write good documentation that makes the project more interesting to recruiters and hiring managers.

To set you on a good path, here are some ideas about how to get started with your project team.

### Project Ideas

Brainstorm some ideas for your project. My recommendation is to use languages and technologies that the majority of your team is already comfortable with, although that's just a recommendation. Once you have brainstormed many ideas, narrow it down to the two or three that you are most excited to work on. For each of those project ideas, you can think doing a bit more planning, with a pitch, wireframe and milestones.

### Project Pitch

Your pitch should be a 1-paragraph description of your project. What is the goal it is trying to achieve? What languages and technologies will you use to build it?

### Wireframes

A wireframe is a simple drawing that represents how your application should behave. Depending on the type of project you want to build, this may or may not be relevant, but if your project has a GUI/front-end, then you should make a simple drawing of what you expect it to look like.

### Milestones

To plan for your project, you'll want to lay out some milestones of project development, and when you think you might hit those milestones. It's normal to make more milestones than you think you'll be able to complete during the project time allocated; that way, if you do finish early, you'll have some stretch goals you can work on.

As you build your milestones, you can think about the concept of *minimum viable product*, or MVP. This is commonly used in software engineering to refer to the simplest form of a project that still has some value. Your milestones should get to "something usable" as quickly as possible, and then should add more features to make the application more fully-featured while maintaining the existing functionality.

The classic image below is more fully explained in [this blog post](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp).

For example, some simple milestones for a recipe tracker web app might look like:

```
Milestone 1: the basic file structure is created and the page has a title (estimated by end of today)
Milestone 2: One recipe is visible on the page (estimated by noon on Wednesday)
Milestone 3: The user can add a recipe to the page using a form (estimated by noon on Thursday)
Milestone 4: The user can delete existing recipes from the page (estimated by the end of the day on Thursday)
Milestone 5: The user can add pictures of their recipes (stretch goal)
Milestone 6: The user can edit existing recipes (stretch goal)
```

### Some Free Project Ideas

- A command line choose-your-own-adventure game
- A data science project on some cool Kaggle data (working on a jupyter notebook or similar)
- A web frontend that allows users to write in a journal
- A mobile app for making todo lists

## What Next?

When you've settled on a project idea, your next step is to **show it to Michelle**. She'll take a look at your pitch, project milestones, and any wireframes or other descriptions of your project, and give you feedback and tips on anything that you might want to flesh out further before you start writing code.

Then, once you have the green light, you can create a GitHub repo and add your teammates as collaborators.
