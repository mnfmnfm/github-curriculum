# Presentation Guidelines

* Presentations start Friday at 12:30pm
    * During presentations, audience laptops are shut, you're paying full attention to other groups' presentations!
* 5-8 minutes long
* Every person in your group talks about something
* Required presentation components:
    * Show us your README file on GitHub as you explain what your application is/does
        * This should include your planning work, so show us your pitch/wireframes
    * Do a demo of your running application
        * (if your application is not running, 😞, do your best to explain how it would run)
    * Tell us what technologies you used to build this
    * Tell us any interesting stories you've got from development
        * git things that were tricky and how you resolved them?
        * code things that were tricky and how you resolved them?
        * pro tips for anyone who tries to build using the same technologies in the future?
        * try to make sure these are understandable to people who have not been working on your project for the last several days
    * Tell us about stretch goals you didn't get to/next steps
* Optional presentation components:
    * Slides (you can just use your README file, or make slides if you want to)
